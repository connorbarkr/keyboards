# keyboards

These are the custom firmware setups for my keyboards; currently, my daily driver is a handwired Skeletyl, with a 5x3 Kyria as a backup. The setups are customized to suit my preferences re: programming language, common shortcuts, and operating systems. They can swap between Colemak and QWERTY, and are fully functional for anything you'd want to do with an ordinary keyboard.
